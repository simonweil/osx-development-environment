===============================
Configuring OSX for Development
===============================

This doc assumes you are doing a clean install of `Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/>`_ on a clean install of OSX 10.9.x (Mavericks) with Xcode 5.x.
If you've got MacPorts installed or have otherwise already buggered up your system, you'll either need to live with your decision or do a clean install and start from scratch.

This guide is geared primarily towards Django and Rails development. If you use another web framework, you'll either need to live with your decision or start from scratch with Django or Rails ;)

Without further ado...

Install OSX Command Line Tools
------------------------------

These tools used to be included in XCode but no more. 
Now you must log into your Apple developer account (which means you'll need said account) and `download <https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action>`_.
Be sure to select the correct download for your version of OSX.

Homebrew
--------

Install::


    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    brew doctor

Bash
----

Install::

    brew install bash

Update the default shell::

    sudo vi /etc/shells

Add the path to the shell you want to use if not already present, then set it::

    chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash

Bash completion
---------------

Install::

    brew install bash-completion2

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    Add the following to your ~/.bash_profile:
      if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
        . $(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
      fi
    
      Homebrew's own bash completion script has been linked into
        /usr/local/share/bash-completion/completions
      bash-completion will automatically source it when you invoke `brew`.
    
      Any completion scripts in /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d
      will continue to be sourced as well.

Add to your ``~/.bash_profile``::

    if [ -f $(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
        . $(brew --prefix)/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
    fi

Now activate it::

    source ~/.bash_profile

You should also add (to enable colors in the shell)::

    export CLICOLOR=1

wget
----

Handy to have in general (especially if you're copy/paste-ing someone else's commands...like below in this very document)::

    brew install wget

rsync
-----

OSX's default ``rsync`` is old and dumb. Replace it::

    brew tap homebrew/dupes
    brew install rsync
    brew untap homebrew/dupes

Programming Languages & Web Frameworks
======================================

Python
------

Homebrew installs pip and distribute by default when installing Python::

    brew install pyenv

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To enable shims and autocompletion add to your profile:
      if which pyenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv init -)"; fi

    To use Homebrew's directories rather than ~/.pyenv add to your profile:
      export PYENV_ROOT=/usr/local/opt/pyenv

Install::

    brew install pyenv-virtualenv

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To enable auto-activation add to your profile:
      if which pyenv-virtualenv-init > /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"; fi

Python 2::

    pyenv install 2.7.9

Python 3::

    pyenv install 3.4.2

To create a virtualenv::

    pyenv virtualenv 3.4.2 myenv

iPython::

    pip install ipython

iPython notebook (install zeromq first, see directions below)::

    pip install pyzmq tornado Jinja2

You'll also need numpy to build gdal::

    pip install numpy

Django bash completion::

    brew install homebrew/completions/django-completion

Ruby & Rails
------------

This installs both Ruby and Rails in one go::

    \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --rails --autolibs=enabled

Sass::

    gem install sass

Less::

    brew install node
    npm install -g less

Version Control
===============

Mercurial::

    brew install mercurial

Git::

    brew install git

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    The OS X keychain credential helper has been installed to:
      /usr/local/bin/git-credential-osxkeychain

    The "contrib" directory has been installed to:
      /usr/local/share/git-core/contrib

    Bash completion has been installed to:
      /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d

    zsh completion has been installed to:
      /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions

SVN::

    brew install subversion

Data Stores
===========

PostgreSQL
----------

Install::

    brew install postgres

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    If builds of PostgreSQL 9 are failing and you have version 8.x installed,
    you may need to remove the previous version first. See:
      https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/2510

    To migrate existing data from a previous major version (pre-9.4) of PostgreSQL, see:
      http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/upgrading.html

    To have launchd start postgresql at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load postgresql now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

PostGIS::

    brew install libgeoip
    brew install postgis

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To create a spatially-enabled database, see the documentation:
      http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.1/postgis_installation.html#create_new_db_extensions
    If you are currently using PostGIS 2.0+, you can go the soft upgrade path:
      ALTER EXTENSION postgis UPDATE TO "2.1.5";
    Users of 1.5 and below will need to go the hard-upgrade path, see here:
      http://postgis.net/docs/manual-2.1/postgis_installation.html#upgrading

    PostGIS SQL scripts installed to:
      /usr/local/share/postgis
    PostGIS plugin libraries installed to:
      /usr/local/opt/postgresql/lib
    PostGIS extension modules installed to:
      /usr/local/opt/postgresql/share/postgresql/extension

To create a database instance::

    initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8

You can now start the database server using::

    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start

Or to set it to start automatically, see the output above after installing postgresql.

Create the spatially enabled template::

    createdb template_postgis
    psql -f /usr/local/share/postgis/postgis.sql template_postgis
    psql -f /usr/local/share/postgis/spatial_ref_sys.sql template_postgis

Create users::

    createuser -s web

To create a spatially enabled database::

    createdb -T template_postgis mydbname

MySQL
-----

PostgreSQL is always preferred but sometimes you don't have a choice::

    brew install mysql

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
    server starting up correctly.

    To connect:
        mysql -uroot

    To have launchd start mysql at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load mysql now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        mysql.server start

Create a database and set permissions for development::

    mysql -uroot

    CREATE DATABASE project CHARACTER SET UTF8;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON project.* TO 'web'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

MariaDB
-------
This is a drop-in replacement for MySQL by the original authors (forked after Oracle bought Sun)::

    brew install mariadb

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    A "/etc/my.cnf" from another install may interfere with a Homebrew-built
    server starting up correctly.

    To connect:
        mysql -uroot

    To have launchd start mysql at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load mysql now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mysql.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        mysql.server start

MongoDB
-------

Install::

    brew install mongodb

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To have launchd start mongodb at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mongodb/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load mongodb now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        mongod


You have to create a data directory. By default it expects the data to be stored in ``/data/db``
Otherwise, create a directory and pass the path when running the server::

    mongod --dbpath=/Users/sallysue/Projects/data/mongodb

Redis
-----

Install::

    brew install redis

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To have launchd start redis at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load redis now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf

memcached
---------

Install::

    brew install memcached

Output::

    To have launchd start memcached at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/memcached/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load memcached now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.memcached.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        /usr/local/opt/memcached/bin/memcached


Task Queues
===========

Rabbit MQ
---------

Install::

    brew install rabbitmq

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    Management Plugin enabled by default at http://localhost:15672

    Bash completion has been installed to:
      /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d

    To have launchd start rabbitmq at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/rabbitmq/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load rabbitmq now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.rabbitmq.plist
    Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
        rabbitmq-server

ZeroMQ
------

Install::

    brew install zeromq

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    To install the zmq gem on 10.6 with the system Ruby on a 64-bit machine,
    you may need to do:

    ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install zmq -- --with-zmq-dir=/usr/local/opt/zeromq

Celery
------

Homepage => https://github.com/celery/django-celery/

Install::

    pip install -U Celery

To run::

    ./manage.py celeryd

To configure your Django project to work with Celery/RabbitMQ, see http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/brokers/rabbitmq.html

Web Servers
===========

nginx
-----

Install::

    gem install passenger
    brew install nginx --with-passenger --with-debug --with-spdy --with-gunzip

Output::

    ==> Caveats
    Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

    The default port has been set to 8080 so that nginx can run without sudo.

    If you want to host pages on your local machine to the wider network you
    can change the port to 80 in: /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

    You will then need to run nginx as root: `sudo nginx`.

    To have launchd start nginx at login:
        ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/nginx/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    Then to load nginx now:
        launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.nginx.plist

Apache
------

Homebrew relies on the supplied OSX version of Apache, it just adds modules to it from a tap.
See https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-apache for more information.


Miscellaneous tools
===================

https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX
``brew install pdf2htmlex``

Image processing utils
----------------------

``brew install optipng jpegoptim pngcrush ImageMagick``

OSXFUSE
-------

If you use Parallels or another VM to run a project, you can mount the project folder from the VM to your OSX file system.
This allows you to use your preferred OSX text editor and usual Finder operations.

Download the latest release from the `official site <http://osxfuse.github.io/>`_.
Do not install using homebrew on Yosemite or later as Apple requires kernel extensions to be signed.
Homebrew builds from source and thus there is no signature.
See `this issue <https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/150>`_ for more information.

Mount the VM folder::

    mkdir ~/Projects/myproject
    sshfs web@10.211.55.1:/home/web/myproject /Users/myusername/Projects/myproject -oauto_cache,reconnect,defer_permissions,negative_vncache,volname=somename

Unmount when you are finished::

    umount ~/Projects/myproject

Homebrew maintenance
--------------------

To update your installed brews::

    brew update
    brew outdated
    brew upgrade

Get a checkup from the doctor and follow the doctor's instructions::

    brew doctor
